description: "Own Azure hosting, secretless config, workload identity, Azure SQL connectivity, IaC, and GitHub release delivery for React Router + Prisma v7 web apps that already follow enforce-react-spa-architecture. Use when the work is primarily Azure Container Apps, Azure SQL Database, App Configuration, Key Vault, Managed Identity, Dockerfile or azure.yaml bootstrap, Bicep, GitHub Actions OIDC, GHCR image release, or production deployment verification.

# Azure Spa Clean Architecture Bootstrap

## Overview

Use this skill as the Azure platform and delivery extension on top of `enforce-react-spa-architecture`.
This skill owns:

- Azure Container Apps hosting and network topology
- Azure SQL connectivity and hosted persistence boundaries
- Azure App Configuration, Key Vault, `ManagedIdentityCredential`, and local `DefaultAzureCredential`
- IaC, `azure.yaml`, container packaging, and shared Azure runtime templates
- GitHub `production` Environment, GitHub Actions OIDC, release workflow design, and smoke-test verification

This skill does not own:

- end-user `Microsoft Entra ID` auth contract, redirect URI design, or app registration updates
- GitHub Copilot coding agent cloud-side Azure access through the `copilot` Environment
- spec or planning workflow
- base React Router + Prisma code architecture rules

When the task is primarily app authentication, load [`../azure-spa-entra-auth/SKILL.md`](../azure-spa-entra-auth/SKILL.md).
When the task is primarily GitHub Copilot coding agent Azure access, load [`../github-copilot-azure-access/SKILL.md`](../github-copilot-azure-access/SKILL.md).

## Companion Skill Requirement

- Install `enforce-react-spa-architecture` together with this skill.
- Use this skill only after the companion skill has established code structure, UI guardrails, and verification boundaries.
- Keep Azure-specific concerns here and keep app-code architecture in the companion skill.

## Quick Start

1. Confirm the runtime boundary:
   - keep pure SPA mode only for truly static apps
   - switch to React Router framework runtime before adding secrets, Prisma, hosted SQL access, or protected server behavior
2. Front-load platform prerequisites:
   - Azure tenant, subscription, resource group, and required RBAC
   - VNet, delegated subnet, `Private Endpoint`, and private DNS requirements
   - Azure SQL admin and migration identity requirements
   - GitHub `production` Environment and OIDC deploy identity requirements
3. Read the platform references:
   - Azure hosting baseline: [`references/azure-platform-bootstrap.md`](references/azure-platform-bootstrap.md)
   - Azure identity and SQL overview: [`references/azure-identity-and-sql.md`](references/azure-identity-and-sql.md)
   - Azure SQL identity and permission guidance: [`references/azure-sql-identity-and-permissions.md`](references/azure-sql-identity-and-permissions.md)
   - workload identity and secretless config: [`references/azure-workload-identity-and-secretless-config.md`](references/azure-workload-identity-and-secretless-config.md)
4. Read the delivery references:
   - repository bootstrap and human permissions: [`references/github-repository-operations.md`](references/github-repository-operations.md)
   - GitHub release workflow design: [`references/github-release-delivery.md`](references/github-release-delivery.md)
   - release and handoff checks: [`references/operational-checklist.md`](references/operational-checklist.md)
   - shared template inventory: [`references/template-assets.md`](references/template-assets.md)
5. Start from the shared runtime and delivery assets:
   - `assets/templates/azure.yaml`
   - `assets/templates/Dockerfile`
   - `assets/templates/app/routes/health.ts`
   - `assets/templates/infra/main.bicep`
   - `assets/templates/scripts/azure/postprovision.sh`
   - `assets/templates/.github/workflows/release-azure-delivery.yml`

## Use This Skill For

- Azure Container Apps topology, ingress, probes, and `Private Endpoint` decisions
- Azure SQL Database hosting, connectivity, identity, and migration boundaries
- Azure App Configuration, Key Vault, and secretless runtime bootstrap
- `azure.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, `infra/main.bicep`, and shared runtime template adoption
- GitHub `production` Environment setup, OIDC deploy identity, GHCR release workflow design, and smoke tests
- human bootstrap responsibilities and least-privilege release permissions

## Use Sibling Skills Instead For

- end-user auth, redirect URIs, cookie or PKCE contract, and app registration updates:
  [`../azure-spa-entra-auth/SKILL.md`](../azure-spa-entra-auth/SKILL.md)
- GitHub Copilot coding agent `copilot` Environment, Azure MCP, and read-scoped cloud access:
  [`../github-copilot-azure-access/SKILL.md`](../github-copilot-azure-access/SKILL.md)
- spec-first planning:
  [`../../../planning/spec-driven-workflow/SKILL.md`](../../../planning/spec-driven-workflow/SKILL.md)

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Treat SQLite as local-development-only storage.
- Use Azure SQL Database for every Azure-hosted relational environment.
- Prefer `ManagedIdentityCredential` in hosted runtime and `DefaultAzureCredential` locally after `az login` or `azd auth login`.
- Keep App Configuration and Key Vault as the runtime source of truth instead of `.env`.
- Use GitHub Actions OIDC to Azure. Do not store Azure client secrets in GitHub.
- Keep infra convergence and app rollout separate, even when one workflow orchestrates both.
- Prefer `what-if`-driven infra skip over file-path heuristics.
- Do not assume a container registry push alone updates Azure Container Apps.
- Keep human bootstrap permissions narrower than the standing permissions of day-to-day releasers.

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Establish Azure runtime boundaries

- choose Container Apps topology, ingress, and backing-service connectivity
- document required Azure scopes, RBAC, and network ownership early
- separate runtime identity, migration identity, and deploy identity

### 2. Bootstrap secretless config and persistence

- use App Configuration for non-secret settings and Key Vault for secrets
- verify local `DefaultAzureCredential` and hosted `ManagedIdentityCredential` flows explicitly
- validate Azure SQL connectivity and provider differences before release

### 3. Adopt runtime assets deliberately

- copy and rename the shared templates into the target repository
- keep app-specific naming and callback values only in the destination repository
- keep `/health` stable and cheap for probes and smoke tests

### 4. Prepare release delivery

- use the shared `release-azure-delivery.yml` workflow shape
- keep `publish`, `plan_infra`, `deploy_infra`, `deploy_app`, and `smoke_test` distinct
- keep the GitHub `production` Environment and its OIDC subject stable

### 5. Verify and hand off

- validate workflow YAML and Bicep before release
- verify `what-if` can distinguish app-only releases from real infra changes
- capture the release URL, workflow URL, deployed app URL, and remaining manual follow-up
